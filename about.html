	  <h1>what it is</h1>
	  	<p>A searchable, sortable map and table of the outer limits of higher education in the 2010s.</p>
	  <h1>how it works</h1>
	  	<p>Each organization in the map is listed by name, URL, and online/offline/hybrid. They are sortable by the following subjective attributes:</p>
	  	<h2>Cost to student</h2>
	  	<h2>Benefit Mix</h2>
	  		<p>higher education organizations in the age of unbundling can provide content, socialization, assessment, any two or all three of the above.
		  	<p>The SIZE of each square reflects the benefit mix it offers. e.g.; Content-Socialization-Assessment (ASU Online); Content (Open Courseware); Content-Socialization (MOOC); Socialization (OpenStudy, CityYear); Socialization-Accreditation (Github); Assessment (LearningCounts.org).</p>
		<h2>Business model</h2>
			<p>Business models vary widely. The color represents the business model on a scale of green (for-profit/profit-driven) to blue (nonprofit/mission-driven). Gradations in between will be represented by a mix of the two colors. e.g.; Nonprofit-within existing university, Nonprofit-state-funded, Nonprofit-mixed, For-profit-publicly traded, For-profit-venture, Nonprofit-venture.</p>
			<h2>Audience</h2>
				<p>The intended or potential audience for an innovation can be very narrow or very broad. It’s represented here by a single number (1-Elite to 10-Mass.) For example, Dev Bootcamp, a startup that costs thousands of dollars and is directed at Silicon Valley computer scientists with bachelor’s or advanced degrees, would rate a 1, while Khan Academy, accessible to elementary school students for free, would rate a 10.</p>
			<h2>Traditional-Experimental</h2>
				<p>Rated on a scale of 1 to 4.</p>
